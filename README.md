# TOT App

Develop a Flutter application using the [FreeTestAPI for Dogs](https://freetestapi.com/apis/dogs) to fetch and display information about different dogs. The app should also include live location tracking, allowing the user to record their journey from a source location to a destination. The final app should demonstrate proficiency in Flutter development, API integration, state management, and geolocation handling.

## Running the Application
- Method 1 (Easier)
    An apk file of the release version of the application is stored in the folder named anand. It can either be sent via email or uploading to drive and sharing the link.

- Method 2 
    - Open the root folder in an ide (VS Code or Any prefered IDE) run the following commands
    ```
    flutter pub update
    flutter build apk
    ```
    - The above commands would create an apk file in /build/apps/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk. This file can be uploaded to sent to any android device via email or google drive upload and sharing the link.
